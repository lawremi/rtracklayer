Description: Extensible framework for interacting with multiple genome 
  browsers (currently UCSC built-in) and manipulating 
  annotation tracks in various formats (currently GFF, BED, bedGraph, BED15, and
  WIG built-in). The user may export/import tracks to/from the supported
  browsers, as well as query and modify the browser state, such as the current
  viewport.
